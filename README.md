# RWA-Tokenization
The RWA Tokenization App converts real-world assets into ERC-20 tokens on Arbitrum, enabling secure, fractional ownership and redemption. It features KYC enforcement, custodian-verified settlements, a Node.js backend for event automation, and a sleek HTML/CSS/JS frontend for wallet connection, balance viewing, and on-chain redemption requests.
